    % blockchains are interesting and useful
    Blockchains provide a way to decentralize ledger-keeping systems.
    They are best known for their use in cryptocurrencies, but blockchains also have applications in supply chain tracking, providing data integrity, and any situation where information needs to be immutable.
    To provide immutability, blockchains use Proof of Work to construct an ever growing chain of blocks in a peer to peer network.
