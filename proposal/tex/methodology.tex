\section{Methodology}
\label{sec:methodology}

The methods of this project come in three different styles.
First, we will focus on generating correctness and security proofs.
For this, I will spend a lot of time thinking about the properties of our solution and how they can be formalized.
Second, there comes the implementation.
Over the summer, my collaborators and I built a proof of concept system using python.
I plan to expand the capacity of this implementation.
This task will involve writing and testing code as well as integrating the system with a distributed hash table.
Finally, there will be our methods while analyzing results.
After the system is built, we can simulate attackers with varying intelligence to see how our solution responds.
I will need to be able to write scripts that analyze and visualize the output data.
At the end of all of this, our goal is to publish a paper.
This will involve drafts and proof-reading.

\section{Timeline}

I plan to stick to the following general time frame, which comes in 4 phases.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Proofs.
    In the first phase of the year, I will focus on writing formal security proofs about our solution.
    This will provide verification that our idea is resistant to attacks, increasing legitimacy.
    I expect this phase to last about two months.
    \item Software Development.
    Beginning around November, I will return to the implementation that I worked on over the summer.
    We only implemented a proof of concept, so there is a lot of functionality that remains to be implemented.
    Most importantly, I must port the code from running on a single computer to running on a distributed system with a functional network.
    I estimate that this will last until February 2021.
    \item Analyze Results.
    After the model has been created, I can use it to generate experimental verification that our solution is resistant to attacks.
    I will run simulations and analyze the results.
    This should take around one month.
    \item Prepare Publication.
    I will spend the remainder of the year working towards a publication.
\end{enumerate}
