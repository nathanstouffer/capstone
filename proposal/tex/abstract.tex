    % blockchains are interesting and useful
    Blockchains have applications in cryptocurrencies, supply chain tracking, and providing data integrity.
    The essential service provided by a blockchain is keeping an immutable, decentralized ledger.
    To provide immutability, some blockchains use Proof of Work to construct an ever growing chain of blocks in a peer-to-peer network.
    Miners are expected to expend computational resources to create new blocks.
    Since blocks are intentionally difficult to create, users of a blockchain can trust the information held in the longest blockchain.

    % problem with blockchains
    By design, miners have collective, but not individual, control over a blockchain.
    When miners are sufficiently decentralized, it is infeasible for a coalition of miners to gain explicit control of a blockchain.
    Explicit control would allow a coalition to decide which blocks are added to the chain, reducing the integrity of the system.
    Thus a blockchain performs better when control of the chain is decentralized.
    % maybe get rid of this part
    Decentralization can be difficult to achieve when blockchains grow to an unmanageable length.
    To begin mining, one must download and process the entire chain.
    This is not a problem when the chain is relatively small, but a larger chain (such as Bitcoin) can take days to process.
	Such a long chain prevents lightweight devices from becoming miners and incredibly long bootstrapping time deters participation from users who do have sufficient space.
    Together, these issues make joining a blockchain more difficult.

    % idea for a solution
    Over the summer, I worked with collaborators to devise a method that bypasses the need for every block.
    At a high level, our solution has miners of recent blocks vote for a blockchain summary.
    If sufficiently many votes agree, bootstrapping nodes can trust the blockchain summary and drastically reduce their bootstrapping time.
    For my capstone project, I will complete the solution from this summer and implement a model of the solution.
    Using the model, I will run simulations and extract experimental results.
