% conclude and discuss future work

We set out to devise a protocol for quick and efficient bootstrapping.
Overall, this goal was achieved: our protocol has the ability to run far faster than current onboarding systems.
However, it is important to remember that the protocol still has some kinks that need to be worked out.
In the future, we need to nail down the details of the statistical decision mechanism and collect network data while the simulation is running.
We also suspect that playing with system parameters can reduce the effectiveness of the rejecting strategy, making our protocol more effective.
